    <h2>Ids and Classes Tutorial</h2>

    <!-- Ids are unique and can only refer to a single element 
        while classes can be reused, so ids are very limited in use in that sense-->

    <div id="mainbox" class="redbg greenbd">

<!-- . is for class and # is for id and in emmet can be 
   used along with tags to call them. For example, type span.redbg and see
what happens and type span#redbg and see what happens -->

<!-- This is can be used to call any class or id. For exampl if span required of 
some particular class, we will use span.classname and press enter. See examples below.
the concept can ofcourse be extended to include multiple classes at once like
div.class1.class2.class3.class4.class5 and enter-->

<span class="classname"></span>
<span id="idname"></span>
<div class="class1 class2 class3 class4 class5"></div>
    </div>
</body>
